👋 About Me

Hello there! I’m a student at TU Graz, currently studying Software Engineering & Management. I’m passionate about coding 💻 and always eager to expand my skills in the exciting world of software development 🌐.

🌟 Skills and Experience
Throughout my studies and projects, I’ve had the opportunity to work with several programming languages, including:

🖥️ C – a foundational language that’s helped me understand system-level programming and memory management.

💡 C++ – where I’ve explored object-oriented programming and tackled more complex software projects.

🐍 Python – a versatile language I use for automation, data analysis, and scripting, and I’m always amazed by its vast libraries and capabilities.
I’m continually exploring new languages and frameworks to deepen my understanding of software engineering principles and best practices 🚀.

🎯 Goals

My goals include growing my expertise in both low-level and high-level programming. I’m focused on creating efficient, maintainable, and impactful software solutions that make a difference 🌍.
