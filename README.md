Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m a student at TU Graz, currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering & Management. I'm passionate about coding and continually expanding my skill set in the field of software development.

ðŸŒŸ Skills and Experience
Throughout my studies and projects, I've gained practical experience working with several programming languages, including:

C - foundational language for understanding system-level programming.
C++ - experience in object-oriented programming and complex software projects.
Python - versatile language I've used for automation, data analysis, and scripting.
I'm constantly exploring new languages and frameworks to deepen my understanding of software engineering principles and best practices.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
I aim to further develop my skills in both low-level and high-level programming, with a focus on creating efficient, maintainable, and impactful software solutions.

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project or just chat about tech!
